## Exercise 1: Creating an Azure lab environment by using deployment templates
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create the first Azure virtual network environment by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. Create the second Azure virtual network environment by using an Azure Resource Manager template


#### Task 1: Create the first Azure virtual network environment by using an Azure Resource Manager template
  
1. From the lab virtual machine, start Microsoft Edge and browse to the Azure portal at [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in by using the Microsoft account that has the Owner role in the target Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **Bash** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. If you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, configure storage using the following settings:

    - Subsciption: the name of the target Azure subscription

    - Cloud Shell region: the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az3000400-LabRG**

    - Storage account: a name of a new storage account

    - File share: a name of a new file share

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, create two resource groups by running (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location)

   ```
   az group create --resource-group az3000401-LabRG --location <Azure region>
   az group create --resource-group az3000402-LabRG --location <Azure region>
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the first Azure Resource Manager template **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T02\\Module_03\\azuredeploy0401.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the parameter file **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T02\\Module_03\\azuredeploy04.parameters.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, deploy the two Azure VMs hosting Windows Server 2016 Datacenter into the first virtual network by running:

   ```
   az group deployment create --resource-group az3000401-LabRG --template-file azuredeploy0401.json --parameters @azuredeploy04.parameters.json
   ```

    > **Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but proceed to the next task.


#### Task 1: Create the second Azure virtual network environment by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the second Azure Resource Manager template **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T02\\Module_03\\azuredeploy0402.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, deploy an Azure VM hosting Windows Server 2016 Datacenter into the second virtual network by running:

   ```
   az group deployment create --resource-group az3000402-LabRG --template-file azuredeploy0402.json --parameters @azuredeploy04.parameters.json
   ```

    > **Note**: The second template uses the same parameter file. 

    > **Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but proceed to the next exercise.

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created two Azure virtual networks hosting Azure VMs running Windows Server 2016 Datacenter. 


## Exercise 2: Configuring VNet peering 
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure VNet peering for the first virtual network

1. Configure VNet peering for the second virtual network


#### Task 1: Configure VNet peering for the first virtual network
  
1. In the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, navigate to the **az3000401-vnet** virtual network blade.

1. From the **az3000401-vnet** blade, create a VNet peering with the following settings:

    - Name: **az3000401-vnet-to-az3000402-vnet**

    - Virtual network deployment model: **Resource manager**

    - Subscription: the name of the Azure subscription you are using for this lab

    - Virtual network: **az3000402-vnet**

    - Allow virtual network access: **Enabled**

    - Allow forwarded traffic: disabled

    - Allow gateway transit: disabled

    - Use remote gateways: disabled


#### Task 2: Configure VNet peering for the second virtual network
  
1. In Microsoft Edge, navigate to the **az3000402-vnet** virtual network blade.

1. From the **az3000402-vnet** blade, create a VNet peering with the following settings:

    - Name: **az3000402-vnet-to-az3000401-vnet**

    - Virtual network deployment model: **Resource manager**

    - Subscription: the name of the Azure subscription you are using for this lab

    - Virtual network: **az3000401-vnet**

    - Allow virtual network access: **Enabled**

    - Allow forwarded traffic: disabled

    - Allow gateway transit: disabled

    - Use remote gateways: disabled

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured VNet peering between two virtual networks.


## Exercise 3: Implementing routing
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Enable IP forwarding

1. Configure user defined routing 

1. Configure routing on an Azure VM running Windows Server 2016


#### Task 1: Enable IP forwarding 
  
1. In Microsoft Edge, navigate to the **az3000401-nic2** blade (the NIC of **az3000401-vm2**)

1. On the **az3000401-nic2** blade, modify the **IP configurations** by setting **IP forwarding** to **Enabled**.


#### Task 2: Configure user defined routing 

1. In the Azure portal, create a new route table with the following settings:

    - Name: **az3000402-rt1**

    - Subscription: the name of the Azure subscription you use for this lab

    - Resource group: **az3000402-LabRG**

    - Location: the same Azure region in which you created the virtual networks
  
    - BGP route propagation: **Disabled**

1. In the Azure portal, add to the route table a route with the following settings: 

    - Route name: **custom-route-to-az3000401-vnet**

    - Address prefix: **10.0.0.0/22**

    - Next hop type: **Virtual appliance**

    - Next hop address: **10.0.1.4**

1. In the Azure portal, associate the route table with the **subnet-1** of the **az3000402-vnet**.


#### Task 3: Configure routing on an Azure VM running Windows Server 2016

1. On MIA-CL1, from the Azure portal, start a Remote Desktop session to **az3000401-vm2** Azure VM. 

1. When prompted to authenticate, specify the following credentials:

    - User name: **Student**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1. Once you are connected to az3000401-vm2 via the Remote Desktop session, from **Server Manager**, install the **Remote Access** server role with the **Routing** role service and all required features. 

1. In the Remote Desktop session to az3000401-vm2, start the **Routing and Remote Access** console. 

1. In the **Routing and Remote Access** console, run **Routing and Remote Access Server Setup Wizard** and enable **LAN routing**. 

1. Start **Routing and Remote Access** service.

1. In the Remote Desktop session to az3000401-vm2, start the **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** console and enable **File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)** inbound rule for all profiles.

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured custom routing within the second virtual network.


## Exercise 4: Validating service chaining

1. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, run the following:

   ```pwsh
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 10.0.0.4 -TraceRoute
   ```

1. Verify that test is successful and note that the connection was routed over 10.0.1.4


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have validated service chaining between peered virtual networks.
