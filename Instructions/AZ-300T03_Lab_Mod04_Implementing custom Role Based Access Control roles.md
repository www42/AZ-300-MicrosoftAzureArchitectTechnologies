Password: **Pa55w.rd**


## Exercise 1: Define a custom RBAC role
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. Identify actions to delegate via RBAC

1. Create a custom RBAC role in an Azure AD tenant


#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the lab virtual machine, start Microsoft Edge and browse to the Azure portal at [**http://portal.azure.com**](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in by using the Microsoft account that has the Owner role in the target Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. If you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, configure storage using the following settings:

    - Subsciption: the name of the target Azure subscription

    - Cloud Shell region: the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location

    - Resource group: the name of a new resource group **az3000900-LabRG**

    - Storage account: a name of a new storage account

    - File share: a name of a new file share

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, create a resource groups by running (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the lab location)

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name az3000901-LabRG -Location <Azure region>
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the Azure Resource Manager template **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_04\\azuredeploy09.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the parameter file **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_04\\azuredeploy09.parameters.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, deploy an Azure VM hosting Ubuntu by running:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName az3000901-LabRG -TemplateFile $home/azuredeploy09.json -TemplateParameterFile $home/azuredeploy09.parameters.json
   ```

    > **Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next task. 

1. In the Azure portal, close the Cloud Shell pane.


#### Task 2: Identify actions to delegate via RBAC

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az3000901-LabRG** blade.

1. On the **az3000901-LabRG** blade, click **Access Control (IAM)**.

1. On the **az3000901-LabRG - Access Control (IAM)** blade, click **Roles**.

1. On the **Roles** blade, click **Owner**.

1. On the **Owner** blade, click **Permissions**.

1. On the **Permissions (preview)** blade, click **Microsoft Compute**.

1. On the **Microsoft Compute** blade, click **Virtual machines**.

1. On the **Virtual Machines** blade, review the list of management actions that can be delegated through RBAC. Note that they include the **Deallocate Virtual Machine** and **Start Virtual Machine** actions.


#### Task 3: Create a custom RBAC role in an Azure AD tenant

1. On the lab computer, open the file **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_04\\customRoleDefinition09.json** and review its content:

   ```json
   {
      "Name": "Virtual Machine Operator (Custom)",
      "Id": null,
      "IsCustom": true,
      "Description": "Allows to start and stop (deallocate) Azure VMs",
      "Actions": [
          "Microsoft.Compute/*/read",
          "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deallocate/action",
          "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action"
      ],
      "NotActions": [
      ],
      "AssignableScopes": [
          "/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
      ]
   }
   ```

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the Azure Resource Manager template **\\allfiles\\AZ-300T03\\Module_04\\customRoleDefinition09.json** into the home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to replace the **$SUBSCRIPTION\_ID** placeholder with the ID value of the Azure subscription:

   ```pwsh
   $subscription_id = (Get-AzContext).Subscription.id
   (Get-Content -Path $HOME/customRoleDefinition09.json) -Replace 'SUBSCRIPTION_ID', "$subscription_id" | Set-Content -Path $HOME/customRoleDefinition09.json
   ```
 
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the custom role definition:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzRoleDefinition -InputFile $HOME/customRoleDefinition09.json
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to verify that the role was created successfully:

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzRoleDefinition -Name 'Virtual Machine Operator (Custom)'
   ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.


> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have defined a custom RBAC role


## Exercise 2: Assign and test a custom RBAC role
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an Azure AD user

1. Create an RBAC role assignment

1. Test the RBAC role assignment


#### Task 1: Create an Azure AD user

1. In the Azure portal, in the Microsoft Edge window, start a **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to explicitly authenticate to the target Azure AD tenant:

   Connect-AzureAD
   ```
   
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify the Azure AD DNS domain name:

   ```pwsh
   $domainName = ((Get-AzureAdTenantDetail).VerifiedDomains)[0].Name
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure AD user:

   ```pwsh
   $passwordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
   $passwordProfile.Password = 'Pa55w.rd1234'
   $passwordProfile.ForceChangePasswordNextLogin = $false
   New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $true -DisplayName 'lab user0901' -PasswordProfile $passwordProfile -MailNickName 'labuser0901' -UserPrincipalName "labuser0901@$domainName"
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify the user principal name of the newly created Azure AD user:

   ```pwsh
   (Get-AzureADUser -Filter "MailNickName eq 'labuser0901'").UserPrincipalName
   ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.


#### Task 2: Create an RBAC role assignment
